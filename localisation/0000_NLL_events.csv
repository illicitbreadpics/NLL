EVTNAME770003;The Empire Invincible;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC770003;With its rich and teeming lands, France has been the hegemon of Europe for centuries. But only through the Emperor has it become the unstoppable force it is today. The Empire stands firm despite relentless assault, guarded by the might of the Grande Armee and the majesty of the line of Bonaparte. Great banks tally francs flowing through a hundred nations as they find their way into the Empire's coffers. German nationalists and Italian revolutionaries discuss in French how best to shake the behemoth. The continent rests firmly in the shade of the Eagle's wings. \n\nNOTE: For reasons that will soon become clear, please do not move or disband your armies in France except- the Legion Etrangere and the Marins de la Garde. For the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
